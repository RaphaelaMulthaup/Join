              If you have given consent to data processing, we process your
              personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and Art. 9(2)(a)
              GDPR if special data categories according to Art. 9(1) GDPR are
              processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of
              personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on
              Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of
              cookies or to access to information on your end device (e.g., via
              device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally based on §

              Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is
              necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation on the basis
              of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. The data processing may also be based on our
              legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information on
              the relevant legal bases in each individual case is provided in
              the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.

              data to external parties if this is necessary within the framework
              of contract fulfillment, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g.,
              transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate
              interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR in the transfer, or if
              another legal basis allows the data transfer. When using
              processors, we only transfer personal data of our customers on the
              basis of a valid processing contract. In the case of joint
              processing, a joint processing contract is concluded.
