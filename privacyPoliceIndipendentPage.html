If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, provided we do not have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.</p>
                    <h4 class="h4PrivacyPolicy">General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on This Website</h4> 
                    <p class="textPrivacyPolicy">If you have given consent to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special data categories according to Art. 9(1) GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access to information on your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally based on § 25(1) TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the performance of a contract or for pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. The data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information on the relevant legal bases in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>

                    <p class="textPrivacyPolicy">In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. In some cases, it is also necessary to transfer personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external parties if this is necessary within the framework of contract fulfillment, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR in the transfer, or if another legal basis allows the data transfer. When using processors, we only transfer personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid processing contract. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing contract is concluded.</p>

                    <p class="textPrivacyPolicy">Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke an already given consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

                    <p class="textPrivacyPolicy">IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

                    <ul> 
                    <li>If you contest the accuracy of your data stored by us, we usually need some time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data.</li> 
                    <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to request a restriction of the processing of your data instead of demanding the deletion of this data.</li> 
                    <li>If we do not need your personal data any longer, but you need it to exercise, defend, or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its deletion.</li> 
                    <li>If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <p class="textPrivacyPolicy">If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – with the exception of their archiving – may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise, or defend legal entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important reasons of public interest cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.</p>
